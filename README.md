# AirCondition
Another example of network and multi-threading with taste of observables!

### How to run?
There are two apps located in the 'server' and the 'client' packages. Start a server and multiple clients.

## Observables and Observers
* **Server side:** Server observes on air condition changes made by the user.
* **Client side:** Clients observe on air condition changes sent by the server.

### What is `JsonStreamParser`?
A class provided in `gson` library. Works much like a scanner but with the purpose of tokenizing jsons.
